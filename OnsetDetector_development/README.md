# OnsetDetector development

These files were used in the initial development and testing of the OnsetDetector
and generated the figures found in Chapter 3 of the thesis.

- **threshold.py** generates Figures 3.2 and 3.3, which show detectors 
with different damping factors, responding to a piano melody.
