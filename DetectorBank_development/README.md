# DetectorBank development

These files were used in the initial development and testing of the DetectorBank
and generated the figures found in Section 2.2 of the thesis.

- **frequency_response.py** This file generates the figures in Section 2.2.1 
Frequency Response. In order to reproduce these results, several features in the 
DetectorBank source must be disabled: amplitude scaling, frequency shifting and 
sample rate limitation.
