# DetectorBank development

These files were used in the initial development and testing of the DetectorBank
and generated the figures found in Section 2.2 of the thesis.

- **frequency_response.py** generates many of the figures in Section 2.2.1 
Frequency Response. In order to reproduce these results, several features in the 
DetectorBank source must be disabled: amplitude scaling, frequency shifting and 
sample rate limitation.

- **oscillations.py** shows the small oscillations in a repsonse, and generates 
Figures 2.4 and 2.7. Requires `peakdetect.py`, originally found 
[here](https://gist.github.com/endolith/250860#file-peakdetect-py).

- **eccentricity.py** plots the complex response at 5Hz and 400Hz, to illustrate
orbital eccentricity. Figures 2.5 and 2.6.

- **amp_scaling.py** generates Figure 2.12, which shows the decay in response amplitude
 as frequency increases. This script calculates this at two sample rates, for both
 numerical methods and both with and without frequency normalisation, and was originally
 used to generate the `scale_values.inc` file found in the DetectorBank repo.
 Obviously, this requires amplitude scaling to be disabled, along with frequency shifting.
 
- **freq_shifting.py** tests frequency shifting and makes Figure 2.14. 
Uses the FFT method, but FIRs can be selected.

- **find_f_shift.py** makes Figure 2.15, from which the point at which frequency shifting
is automatically applied is found. Again, frequency shifitng should be disabled in the 
DetectorBank source.
 
- **freqz.py** plots the frequency response curve seen in Figure 2.16. File of DetectorBank
peak responses generated by `test_system_response.py`.

- **prop_freq.py** plots responses near to the driving frequency (Figure 2.17) and prints
the data shown in Table 2.4.
