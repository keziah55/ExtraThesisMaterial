# Extra thesis material

A repository of Python scripts used in the development and 
testing of the software I created for my PhD thesis.

Documentation and installation instructions for the software – DetectorBank – 
is hosted [here](https://github.com/keziah55/DetectorBank)

Each directory contains it's own readme, describing the files.
These will be updated shortly.

A number of the files use `SavePlot` or `SaveLegend` objects, which can 
be found [here](https://github.com/keziah55/save_plot).
