# Extra thesis material

A repository of Python scripts used in the development and 
testing of the software I created for my PhD thesis.

The software â€“ DetectorBank - is hosted [here](https://github.com/keziah55/DetectorBank).

Each directory contains it's own readme, describing the files.
These will be updated shortly.
