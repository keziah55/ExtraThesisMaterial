# OnsetDetector testing

These files were used to test the OnsetDetector.
The data files were the from the 
[University of Iowa musical instrument samples](http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html);
with the exception of the guitar samples, each file contains a single note
on a given instrument. The guitar files were manually split into notes by me.

To run many of these files yourself, you'll have to update paths to where you have
saved the Iowa samples and where you would like data to be saved.

As stated in the main readme, many of these files use `SavePlot` or `SaveLegend` objects,
available [here](https://github.com/keziah55/save_plot).

- **count_onsets.py** contains functions to count the total number of onsets in the 
University of Iowa musical instrument samples.

- **plot_Iowa_note.py** plots the waveform of a sample, optionally with manually
and/or automatically found onsets marked. 

- **analyse_debug_files.py** was used to debug the OnsetDetector by analysing its state
before true and false positives, using log files that were generated by the OnsetDetector.
