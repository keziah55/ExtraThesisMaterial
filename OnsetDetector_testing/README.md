# OnsetDetector testing

These files were used to test the OnsetDetector.
The data files were the from the 
[University of Iowa musical instrument samples](http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html);
with the exception of the guitar samples, each file contains a single note
on a given instrument. The guitar files were manually split into notes by me.

Descriptions of each file will follow soon.
